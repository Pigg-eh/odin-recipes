    <h1>Oyakodon</h1>
    <img src="../img/oyakodon.webp" alt="Chicken Oyakodon">
    <h4> Egg and parent rice bowl, made with pairing soft scrambled eggs with chicken and mirin topped eloquently over rice. When it comes to mainstream fast food, Japan offers not only hamburgers and french fries, but the menu also extends to noodles and donburi (rice bowl) meals.

    <p>During lunchtime, you’d see diners and cafeterias around the office buildings crowded with Japanese salarymen and office ladies making their fuss-free fast food orders. These lunch spots usually serve up quick one-bowl meals, and Oyakodon (親子丼) or Oyako Donburi (親子丼ぶり) is often one of the popular choices.</p></h4>

<ul>
    <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>2 Eggs</li>
    <li>½ onion</li>
    <li>1 cup Dashi</li>
    <li>1½ Mirin</li>
    <li>1½ Tbsp sake</li>
    <li>1½ Tbsp Soy Sauce</li> 
    <li>1½ tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 bowl of rice</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients  </li>
    <li>Combine the dashi, mirin, sake, and soy sauce in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup.</li>
    <li>Add the sugar and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved. Depending on the size of your frying pan, you may not need all the broth. You can keep the leftovers in the refrigerator for 3 days.</li>
    <li>Thinly slice the onion and chop the green onions. Beat one egg in a small bowl (you will need to beat the other egg when you work on the second batch).</li>
    <li>Slice the chicken thighs diagonally into pieces that are about 1½-inches (4 cm) long and ½-inch (1.3 cm) thick.</li>
    <li>With the stove off, add 1 serving of the sliced onions to the pan in a single layer. Add roughly one-third to one-half of the seasonings mixture </li>
    <li>Add 1 serving of the chicken on top of the onions. Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Then, turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, lower the heat to medium low. Skim off any foam or scum that appears. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender.</li>
    <li>Taste the broth and see if you need to adjust. Slowly drizzle the beaten egg evenly over the chicken and onions. Cook covered on medium-low heat until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny.</li>
    <li>Add the green onion right before removing from the heat. Slide the cooked chicken and egg onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of remaining sauce on top.</li>

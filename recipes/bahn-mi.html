        <p>In Vietnamese cuisine, bánh mì is a short baguette with thin, crisp crust and soft, airy texture. It is often split lengthwise and filled with savory ingredients like a submarine sandwich and served as a meal, called bánh mì thịt. Plain banh mi is also eaten as a staple food.</p>
        <p>A typical Vietnamese roll or sandwich is a fusion of meats and vegetables from native Vietnamese cuisine such as chả lụa (pork sausage), coriander leaf (cilantro), cucumber, pickled carrots, and pickled daikon combined with condiments from French cuisine such as pâté, along with red chili and buttery mayonnaise.[7] However, a wide variety of popular fillings are used, from xíu mại (a Chinese cuisine) to even ice cream. In Vietnam, bread rolls and sandwiches are typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack.</p>
